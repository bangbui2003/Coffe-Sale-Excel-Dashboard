<h1 align="center">Project - Coffee Shop Data Analysis using Power BI</h1>

### About Project üë®‚Äçüíª
In this project, I work with a dataset that includes comprehensive sales information from a coffee shop: transactions, sales channels, coffee product. With Excel, I aim to create an interactive report that provides insights into the coffee shop's sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. This report will help in understanding the coffee shop's business operations and support data-driven decision-making.

#### Project Content:
- Using INDEXMATCH, XLOOKUP to collect data for one data table based on other data tables
